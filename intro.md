Statistical Physics for Nanobiology
============================

These lecture notes are written for the Statistical Physics course in the
Nanobiology programme at TU Delft, and are open for reuse (license will be
added in the bottom of the page).

## Meeting notes :)
* I'm Lucas
* Goal: publish complete open lecture notes for Statistical Physics online on
a website that looks like this
* Gather feedback from students to optimize the course towards them (e.g.
  how to share solutions)
