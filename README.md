# nb2220-test
Test version for publishing the open lecture notes that are being developed for the course NB2220 Statistical Physics at TU Delft.

## How the website is going to work
* Jupyter Book is a Python module that can build markdown and .ipynb files into
a website that looks like this (you can also include python scripts for
interactive plots, etc.)
* The idea is to keep track of the markdown files on GitLab, and publish (deploy)
the website from there.
* This can be done using Netlify, or possibly a GitLab pipeline
