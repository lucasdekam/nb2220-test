Project notes
=======================

Currently:
* lack of open readable Statistical Physics texts, especially
for students who have little background and interest in quantum mechanics

Goal:
* Publish complete open lecture notes for Statistical Physics online on
a website that looks like this
* Focus on biology rather than quantum mechanics, include biological examples

How:
* Jos will write lecture notes and problem sets
* I will organize the notes in a website and suggest improvements, make sure
they connect well to what Nanobiology students know and want to know
* We will gather feedback from students to optimize the course towards them (e.g.
  how to share solutions)
