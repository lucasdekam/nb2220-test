Project notes
=======================

## Meeting notes 9-6-2021
* I'm Lucas
* Currently: lack of open readable Statistical Physics texts, especially
for students who have little background and interest in quantum mechanics
* Goal: publish complete open lecture notes for Statistical Physics online on
a website that looks like this
* Jos will write lecture notes and problem sets; I will organize these
on this website and suggest improvements
* Lecture notes should be easy to understand, but still give a solid foundation
in the basics and the mathematics behind statistical physics
* Include biological examples
* Gather feedback from students to optimize the course towards them (e.g.
  how to share solutions)
