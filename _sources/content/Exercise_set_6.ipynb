    "## Nucleation and growth\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the Swedish scientist\n",
    "Anders Celsius developed a temperature scale that is now named after\n",
    "him. Orginally he defined the boiling point of water at a pressure of 1\n",
    "atm ($\\approx 10^5 \\;\\mathrm{Pa}$) to be 0 degrees, and the freezing point to be\n",
    "100 degrees. Shortly after, the scale was reversed by the French\n",
    "scientist Christin, and independently by the Swedish botanist Carl\n",
    "Linnaeus. The Celsius and Kelvin scale are essentially identical, in the\n",
    "sense that a temperature difference of $1\\;^\\mathrm{o}\\mathrm{C}$ is equal to a\n",
    "difference of $1 \\;\\mathrm{K}$, except that the absolute values are shifted,\n",
    "$0\\;^\\mathrm{o}\\mathrm{C}=273.15 \\;\\mathrm{K}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "During phase transitions such as freezing and boiling the molecules of a\n",
    "substance radically change their configuration or density. These\n",
    "transitions can be induced by a change in temperature or pressure, or by\n",
    "external fields. During the process of freezing, the molecules in a\n",
    "liquid phase lose their ability to diffuse and get trapped in an\n",
    "ordered, crystalline lattice. This usually happens by a process called\n",
    "\\\"nucleation and growth\\\" where a small nucleus of frozen molecules\n",
    "grows larger and larger over time, after overcoming a \\\"nucleation\n",
    "barrier\\\". To overcome this energy barrier, nuclei first need to grow\n",
    "large enough by thermal fluctuations before they can grow spontaneously\n",
    "(i.e. before growth leads to a lowering of the free energy). If the\n",
    "temperature of the environment is not too low, the nucleation barrier\n",
    "may be sufficiently high to prevent multiple nuclei overcoming the\n",
    "nucleation barrier. In that case, the new phase will grow from a single\n",
    "nucleus and may have a high degree of symmetry. On the other hand, if\n",
    "multiple nuclei start growing at the same time, the resulting phase may\n",
    "consist of many crystalline domains, separated by fault lines and\n",
    "defects. For some applications, this may be highly desirable, while for\n",
    "others it is not (see exercise). {numref}`liquid_crystal_domains` shows a\n",

    "A phase transition can also happen by another type of process, where the\n",
    "transition happens spontaneously, everywhere, and almost\n",
    "instantaneously. This process has the fancy name of \"spinodal\n",
    "decomposition\", and happens after one disturbs a supercooled phase.\n",
    "This phenomenon is responsible for freezing rain. Under special weather\n",
    "conditions, rain drops can be cooled below the freezing temperature of\n",
    "water on their way to the earth's surface, and hit the ground before\n",
    "they have the time to freeze via nucleation. The shockwave of the impact\n",
    "is sufficient to start the phase transition at every point at the same\n",
    "time, making the droplet freeze in an instant. This phenomenon may be\n",
    "beautiful to behold, but can, understandably, also be a major\n",
    "disturbance for traffic and infrastructure. In northern places where\n",
    "this phenomenon is more common, it is feared by trees and electricity\n",
    "lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In discussions about phase transitions, water seems a natural example,\n",
    "because of its abundance and relevance for life, and our experience with\n",

    "substances do not have, and some of them are still not understood. We\n",
    "will skip that discussion for now.\n",

    "1.  Recipes usually recommend adding salt to boiling water before adding\n",
    "    pasta, to make the pasta less sticky. When one adds salt to boiling\n",
    "    water, it usually produces a short burst of bubbles. Why would this\n",

    "    the formation of ice crystals in their body, in places where water\n",
    "    is allowed to freeze. To prevent desiccation via osmosis, their body\n",
    "    also produces higher levels of glucose. Eventually their heartbeat\n",

    "make nature at its smallest scales rather 'sticky'. The origin of these\n",
    "forces is electromagnetic. Electrons orbiting the nucleus of an atom\n",

    "separate into two phases, a dense liquid phase, and a dilute gas phase.\n",
    "He constructed a model, based on the ideal gas, but with two extra\n",
    "modifications. One modification was to change the volume $V$ by\n",
    "subtracting the volume occupied by the fluid (effectively giving the\n",
    "particles a 'size' such that they can collide with each other), and the\n",
    "other modification was to make the fluid cohesive (equivalent to adding\n",
    "attractive forces between the particles). His model predicted that such\n",
    "fluids can phase separate, if the temperature is sufficiently low, and\n",
    "that there is a 'critical temperature' and 'critical density' where the\n",
    "fluid is just about to separate. This exercise will guide you through\n",
    "his model. James Clerk Maxwell was so curious to learn about his work\n",
