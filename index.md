Statistical Physics for Nanobiology
============================

These lecture notes are written for the Statistical Physics course in the BSc
Nanobiology at TU Delft. This course gives an introduction to the field of
Statistical Physics and its applications in biological research. The lecture
notes are a 'hybrid' between theory and problems. Because the problems contain
important derivations, it is essential to attend the tutorials, where these
derivations are discussed.

This collection of lecture notes and problems is part of a project to develop open learning materials for Nanobiology ([Dutch project description](https://www.surf.nl/open-leermaterialen-in-een-multidisciplinaire-opleiding-een-brug-tussen-natuurkunde-en-biologie)).
